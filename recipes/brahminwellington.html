    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Quite possibly the peak of wasteland cuisine. Only the fanciest and most deserving of guests should be allowed to eat this dish.</p>
    <p>You'll be giving your compliments to the chef and wondering where he gets such fine cuts of meat! Just don't wonder too much...</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lb Eye-of-round-beef roast (real Wellington is expensive!)</li>
        <li>2 cups Diet Cola</li>
        <li>1-2 Jalapenos, minced, seeds removed</li>
        <li>1/2 lb Prosciutto or sliced ham cold cuts</li>
        <li>7.25 oz box Kraft macaroni and cheese</li>
        <li>2 tbsp margarine</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp basil pesto</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
        <li>Pine nuts for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <h4>At least two days before cooking:</h4>
        <li>Carefully remove the fat cap from the roast with a sharp knife. Trim the sides of the roast until the thickness is mostly uniform.</li>
        <li>Place the roast in the ziplock bag and pour in the diet coal. Seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 48 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol type="1">
        <h4>Day of cooking</h4>
        <li>Bring a saucepan of water to a boil on the stovetop. Pour the noodles in and let cook 7 and a half minutes, stirring to prevent clumping. Reserve approximately 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining. Stir in the margarine, then the cheese powder, then a splash of pasta water. Let sit to cool.</li>
        <li>Remove the roast from the bag and dry completely with paper towels. Discard the marinade. Season the roast liberally on all sides with kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Heat the skillet on the stovetop with a layer of cooking oil over high heat. Brown the roast for a minute on each side and transfer to a cutting board. Coat the roast with pesto.</li>
        <li>Add the minced jalapeno to the hot pan and saute for a minute before stirring it into the pot of mac and cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover your work surface with overlapping layers of plastic wrap that are twice as long and wide as the roast. Place overlapping strips of ham or prosciutto onto the plastic into a large rectangle.</li>
        <li>Beat one of the eggs and stir into the mac and cheese. Spread a layer of mac and cheese onto the prosciutto, leaving a seam allowance of at least two inches.</li>
        <li>Place the roast on one end of the rectangle and roll to wrap it — using the plastic to guide and tighten. Twist the ends of the plastic wrap and tuck under the roast and chill in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover your work surface with another set of overlapping layers of plastic wrap. Overlap the thawed puff pastry sheets and press together. Flatten the pastry with a rolling pin to a large, even square on top of the plastic.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400° F.</li>
        <li>Remove the roast from the fridge and unwrap the plastic wrap and place it on the pastry. Using the plastic wrap to guide and tighten, roll and cover the roast in pastry. Cut the excess dough and twist the ends of the plastic to seal. Chill in the fridge for another 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the oven preheats, roll the remaining dough out and cut shapes and strips for decoration. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper and coat it lightly with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Unwrap the plastic wrap from the roast and then place it seam-side down on the baking sheet. Decorate the roast with the remaining puff pastry dough and brush with beaten egg. Season lightly with kosher salt then bake for 30-35 minutes, until the roast reaches an internal temperature of 125 F.</li>
        <li>Allow the Brahmin Wellington to rest at least 5-10 minutes before slicing with a serrated bread knife and garnishing with pine nuts.</li>
