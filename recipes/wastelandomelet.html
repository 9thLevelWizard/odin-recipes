    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Wasteland Omelet is a filling meal made with the finest ingredients.</p>
    <p>Every decent wastelander should have this recipe in their books!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten (per omelette)</li>
        <li>½ onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ apple, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 salmon filet</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>½ tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup cheddar</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper (optional), to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Place a pan over medium-high heat and allow it to warm. Salt and pepper the salmon. Place the salmon, skin side down on, in the hot pan and cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook for another 4 minutes or until the salmon is cooked through. Place the salmon on a plate to cool.</li>
        <li>In a pan over high heat begin sauteing the onions. Once they have become translucent, about 5 minutes, add the apple. Cook until the apple has softened. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Next the mac and cheese base. In a saucepan, over medium-high heat melt the butter. Add the flour and whisk together to form a roux.</li>
        <li>As the roux begins to smell like bread slowly whisk in the milk. Turn off the heat, add the cheese and whisk until combined.</li>
        <li>Begin warming a pan over medium heat. Once it is warmed add the beaten eggs and give it a few good swirls with a spatula. Spread it out and let it cook for about 3 minutes or until the edges begin to solidify. Carefully flip the omelette and allow it to cook for another minute. Remove it from the pan carefully onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Pour a thick layer of cheese sauce on top of the omelette. Next place a few spoonfuls of the onion and apple mixture. Finally add a layer of salmon. If you want to give the omelette an extra deathclaw kick, add some cayenne pepper over the salmon before folding the omelette closed.</li>
    </ol>
